  A threadpool is just an ExecutorService with a fixed number of threads. In

  This takes optional keyword arguments:
    :daemon, a boolean indicating whether the threads are daemon threads,
             which will automatically die when the JVM exits, defaults to
             true)
    :name, a string giving the pool name, which will be the prefix of each
