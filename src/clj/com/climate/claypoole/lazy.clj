  "Lazy threadpool tools for Clojure.

  This namespace provides lazy versions of the parallel functions from
  com.climate.claypoole. They will only run the outputs you realize, plus a few
  more (a buffer), just like core pmap. The buffer is used to help keep the
  threadpool busy.

  Each parallel function also comes with a -buffer variant that allows you to
  specify the buffer size. The non -buffer forms use the threadpool size as
  their buffer size.

  To use the threadpool most efficiently with these lazy functions, prefer the
  unordered versions (e.g. upmap), since the ordered ones may starve the
  threadpool of work. For instance, this pmap will take 6 milliseconds to run:
    (lazy/pmap 2 #(Thread/sleep %) [4 3 2 1])
  That's because it will not realize the 2 task until the 4 task is complete,
  so one thread in the pool will sit idle for 1 millisecond."
